description: Drift check for holderbein.dev. Walks resume sync, project freshness, time-based staleness, live-site health, and code health. Reports findings; only edits public/resume.pdf when the source is newer. Everything else is flagged for the user to confirm before changing.
---

# /update

You are running a routine drift check on the holderbein.dev workspace. Walk every
check below in order, then output a single report. Don't auto-edit `site.ts` or
commit anything beyond the resume PDF copy.

## Setup

- Working directory: `/Users/benjaminholderbein/Documents/Personal Projects/holderbein.dev`. If we're not there, stop.
- Source of truth: `src/content/site.ts`. Read it once at the start so all checks reference the same parsed content.
- Resume source: `/Users/benjaminholderbein/Documents/Career/Resumes/main-resume/Benjamin_Holderbein_Resume.pdf`.
- Use the system-context date (today) when evaluating time-based claims.

## Checks

### A. Resume sync

**A1. Resume PDF freshness.**

```bash
cmp -s "/Users/benjaminholderbein/Documents/Career/Resumes/main-resume/Benjamin_Holderbein_Resume.pdf" public/resume.pdf
```

If they differ, compare mtimes. If the source is newer, copy it over `public/resume.pdf`
and `git add` it (do **not** commit yet — surface in the report and let the user
approve commit + push at the end).

**A2. Resume content vs `site.ts`.**

Read the resume PDF. Extract:
- Header role string, location.
- One-line bio header.
- Per-role: title, org, location, dates (start/end), bullet content.
- Education: degrees, school, dates, GPA.

Compare to `site.ts`:
- `site.role`, `site.location`, `site.oneLiner`
- `site.bioShort`, `site.bioLong[]` — does anything claim a role/scope/metric
  that disagrees with the resume?
- `site.experience[*]` — title, org, where, start, end, yearRange, bullets.
  Watch especially: missing or thin bullets where the resume has more, and
  claims on the site that aren't in the resume at all.
- `site.education[*]` — degree names, dates, GPA, "Expected <date>" details.

**Settled exceptions — do not flag:**
- **Frontier Energy dates.** The site encodes Frontier Energy as a single
  continuous range (May 2022 — Aug 2023). The resume splits it into two
  stints (May 2023–Aug 2023 and May 2022–Oct 2022). This is intentional;
  the user has decided the continuous range stays. Do not surface this as
  a mismatch under any framing (date range, stint split, end-date drift,
  etc.).

For each mismatch, output one line in plain English describing the drift.
Don't edit `site.ts`. Don't paraphrase mismatches charitably — quote both
sides if it's ambiguous.

### B. Project freshness

For each entry in `site.projects`:

**B1. Repo vs site blurb.**

Find the GitHub repo via the project's "Repo" link (or first GitHub link).
If no GitHub link, skip and note "no repo to check."

Fetch the repo description + first ~100 lines of README:

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<name> --jq '{description, pushed_at, archived}'
gh api repos/<owner>/<name>/readme --jq .content | base64 -d | head -100
```

Flag if:
- The README leads with tech, scope, or results that the site blurb doesn't mention.
- The status on the site (`live` / `wip` / `archive`) disagrees with the repo
  state (e.g., repo has a clear MVP shipped but site says `wip`; repo
  unchanged for >12 months but site says `live`).
- The README has a clear new headline/result the blurb doesn't capture.

**B2. Link rot.**

Curl every URL in:
- `site.links[*].href` (skip `mailto:` and same-origin like `/resume.pdf`)
- each project's `links[*].href`

```bash
curl -sI -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} %{url_effective}\n" --max-time 10 <url>
```

Anything non-2xx (or non-3xx for known redirects) → flag.

Known false positives — do **not** flag:
- `linkedin.com/*` returns `999` (LinkedIn blocks non-browser HEAD requests).
- `npmjs.com/package/*` returns `403` to bare HEAD (npm bot-blocks). Use
  `curl -sI -A "Mozilla/5.0"` if you want a real check, otherwise skip.

### C. Time-based staleness

Use today's date from the system context.

**C1. `site.availability`.** Parse the month-year. If it's <= today's month, prompt
the user: still accurate or new value? Flag in report.

**C2. `site.education[*].details`.** Look for `Expected <Month> <Year>`. If the
expected date has passed, flag.

**C3. `site.now[*]`.** Scan each item for embedded dates (regex roughly:
`(Jan|Feb|...|Dec|January|February|...|December)\s+\d{4}` or `\(\w+\s+\d{4}\)` or
`by\s+\w+\s+\d{4}`). If any referenced date is in the past, flag.

**C4. `site.experience` with `end: "Present"`.** For each, ask the user (in the
report) to confirm the role is still current. Don't pull from any external
source — confirmation is manual.

### D. Live-site health (probe-only)

```bash
# D1: apex 200
curl -sI https://holderbein.dev | head -1

# D2: TLS expiry — flag if < 30 days
echo | openssl s_client -servername holderbein.dev -connect holderbein.dev:443 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -noout -enddate

# D3: www -> apex 308
curl -sI https://www.holderbein.dev | grep -iE "^(HTTP|location)"

# D4–D5: robots + sitemap 200
curl -sI https://holderbein.dev/robots.txt | head -1
curl -sI https://holderbein.dev/sitemap.xml | head -1

# D6: og image
curl -sI https://holderbein.dev/opengraph-image | grep -iE "^(HTTP|content-type)"

# D7: latest Vercel deploy state (skip if `vercel` not installed or .vercel/ missing)
vercel ls 2>/dev/null | head -5

# D8: the deploy currently serving the apex is at least as new as local HEAD
vercel inspect https://holderbein.dev 2>&1 | grep -E 'url|created'
git log -1 --format='%ai %h %s'
```

For D7, flag if the most recent deploy is not `Ready` (e.g., `Error`, `Building`,
`Queued`). If the CLI isn't installed or the project isn't linked, note "vercel
CLI not available" and move on — don't block the report.

For D8: `vercel inspect https://holderbein.dev` resolves the alias to whichever
deploy is actually serving the apex right now. Parse its `created` timestamp and
compare to `git log -1 --format=%ai`. If the apex-serving deploy is older than
HEAD, either the push hasn't built yet, the build failed, or promotion is stuck
— flag it. (This avoids the false flag from D7's "latest Ready" briefly
mismatching during the normal ~30s–2min promotion window after a push.)

### E. Code health

```bash
npm run build 2>&1 | tail -30
npm run lint 2>&1 | tail -30
npm outdated 2>&1 | tail -30
```

`build` and `lint` must succeed. `npm outdated` is informational — report what's
behind, don't bump.

Note: the `lint` script runs `eslint` directly; empty output = clean (exit 0).
Don't read silence as a failure.

## Reporting

Output one tight report with five sections in order. Use `✓` / `⚠` / `✗`. One
line per check unless a flag needs explanation. Example shape:

```
/update — holderbein.dev — 2026-05-01

A. Resume sync
  ✓ public/resume.pdf matches source
  ⚠ experience[2] (Data Institute) blurb on site is missing the resume's
    "scalable for broader application" framing

B. Project freshness
  ✓ ecommerce-ticket-triage — blurb matches README
  ⚠ llm-from-scratch — README now mentions ~124M params, BPE tokenizer, GPT-2
    small architecture; site blurb is generic ("transformer-based LLM")
  ✓ All 14 project/contact links return 2xx

C. Time-based staleness
  ✓ availability "July 2026" — 3 months out
  ⚠ education[0].details = "Expected June 2026" — past today
  ⚠ now[1] mentions "(June 2026)" — past today
  → confirm: experience[0] (Asurion) end:"Present" — still current?

D. Live-site health
  ✓ apex 200, TLS 87 days, www 308, robots/sitemap/og all 200

E. Code health
  ✓ build passes, lint clean
  ⚠ npm outdated: next 16.2.4 → 16.3.1, react 19.2.4 → 19.3.0
```

After the report, list **suggested actions** as a numbered todo. Each action
should be specific enough to execute on approval (e.g., "Update site.ts:155
blurb to: ..." with the proposed text). Don't execute any of them.

If A1 staged a newer resume PDF, the first suggested action is always:
"Commit + push the resume PDF refresh."

## Editing rules

- The only edit you may make automatically is `cp` of the resume PDF when the
  source is newer (then `git add public/resume.pdf`).
- Don't commit. The user reviews the report and approves edits.
- Don't touch `site.ts`, components, configs, or the design files.
